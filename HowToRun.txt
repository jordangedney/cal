INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE CALENDAR APP
This calendar app was made in xCode for the iOS. To run it you must have a Mac with a
working copy of xCode installed.

Steps to run:
1. First navigate into the "Calendar" folder (the folder this text file was located in).
2. From there navigate into the "CalendarProject" folder.
3. In this folder there should be a file called "CalenderProject.xcodeproj". Double click
   this file to open the project in Xcode.
4. When Xcode finishes opening the project open the drop down menu labeled "Product" and
   hover over "Destination", then click "iPhone Retina (4-inch)". 
5. Lastly click the play button "Build and Run" in the upper left hand corner. If you
   don't see the play button, you can alternatively open the drop down menu labeled
    "Product" and "Build" it, then "Run" it.
6. If all goes well this will open the app in an iOS simulator on screen.
